# baulk

Baulk's goal is a cross-platform package management tool that provides green software primarily on Windows systems, ie no need to install, through soft links, launcher wrapper, to avoid excessive PATH environment variables.

Todo:  
1.   Support for extracting files without installing third-party compression software.
2.   Support for HTTP/SFTP download software.
3.   Calculation file Hash

The above three points are actually the main points of baulk's implementation of green software package management.

As the name of baulk says, this project is just an experimental, conceptual project and therefore may fail.
